#LJ 20
Today was project presentation day and the last of the class. I just realized that I forgot to do the learning journals for yesterday and the day before, which sucks. I feel like we did a really good job on this project, mostly thanks to Shayne and his master CSS work. I cant wait to come back next year to do 301. See you next year!
