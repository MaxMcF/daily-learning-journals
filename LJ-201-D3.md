#LJ-201-D3

Today we mostly went over more Javascript basics. This included loops (for and while statements). These are a lot of fun (I think) because they allow you to repeat code, which saves a ton of space. In the morning we talked about JS and CSS basics (I still cant handle CSS that well...), and then we did some terminal review stuff (Im even worse at this). After lunch we dove into our about me projects, which we updated. Im still having tons of trouble with the terminal commands, as I initially saved my repositories inside the master repository for the class, which is confusing as hell. I still feel like I have a good handle on the whole of the class, but I really need to stay on top of it.
