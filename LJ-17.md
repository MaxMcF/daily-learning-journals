I feel really good about our project. I think were pretty far, as we already complete MVP today. We have a bunch of possible stuff we want to add to the game, so the next challenge will be choosing what else to add. I organized the logic for the most part, but it need another clean up. At the end of the day I add items into the game, which broke the code. Ill fix it tomorrow morning. I feel good about where we are.
