#LJ-201-D5
Today went quite well. I started off a little shaky today cause I forgot my lunch and my gum, which was a bit frustrating since I spent so much time making my lunch on Sunday. I picked up the DOM stuff fairly quickly and was able to complete the lab in a decent amount of time. I accidentally made a table when I wasn't supposed to apparently, even though that wasn't specified in the prompt. The information looked really bad in a list form and so I decided to take it upon myself to make a table, which was *apparently* the wrong thing to do. Oh well, at least I finished tomorrows work today.
