#LJ-D11
Today went quite well. We watched the eclipse halfway through lecture, which was a nice break from lecture. I understand that lecture is very important, but I'm not able to retain as much if I cant get up and walk around every 15 minutes or so. After lecture we started work on the Bus Mall. At around 530pm I went to hack night at the avvo, which was a fantastic resource (and good pizza). I was able to meet the spec for the assignment. Overall doing well.
