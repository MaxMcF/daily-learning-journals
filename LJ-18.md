Today was very productive. We have a fairly complete game at this point. We were able to link up the pictures, add enemy turns, added a health bar, and a ton of other things. Im very tired and drained at this point. Im excited to finish it tomorrow, but i'm worried that play-testing will take too long. Hopefully everything goes smoothly tomorrow.
