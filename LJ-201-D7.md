Today went really well. I finished most of my work fairly early since I made the table yesterday. I tried working on a button that would create input boxes on the page, but I couldn't figure out how to not have the page refresh when I clicked the button. Oh well, Im sure ill get it eventually. Im going to go try and help some people figure out todays assignment now.
