Today went fairly well. The local storage went pretty smoothly, I didn't have any problems, which was nice. The pair programming also went well. We were able to figure out David's code fairly quickly as well. I started the quiz thats due tomorrow, but it seems way too difficult, so ima just put it on the back burner until tomorrow.
