#LJ-201-D4

Today we went over functions and implementing them in JS. We also reviewed more CS formating. For the majority of the lecture, we were mostly reviewing the previous nights reading, which I'm starting to assume is going to be a regular practice. I actually kinda like that, since its a good refresher, and Nick will go over the more important aspects of the reading. For the entirety of the lab, we were working in pairs on our previous days code. I actually had a lot of fun, even though I think I may have scared my partner due to my antics. Mark was a real nice guy, and her knew a lot of commands for JS that I didn't. Felt very productive today!
