#LJ-D10
Today went pretty well. I worked with the other max in a pair programming project that mostly involved CSS. It went really well and we were able to finish an hour before it was due, which was nice. There were a bunch of presentations I saw, which were interesting. Most of the student presentations went over my head, since they were talking about mostly back-end stuff, which I'm completely lost on in a technical sense. This weekend will be good. Hopefully the bus mall wont run me over....... Ill promise to never make another semblance of a joke again.
