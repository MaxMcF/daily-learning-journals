#LJ D9
Today went much better than yesterday. I finally reworked my code enough to meet yesterdays requirements, and I had enough time to add some CSS stuff. I wasn't able to get my submission field required command to work, since I coded my input fields in JS. Hopefully tomorrow goes well. The weekend is almost here and I'm about to sleep... A LOT.
