Well that sucked... Today I had to rewrite almost the entirety of my code since my initial table was too complicated and was definitely not set up correctly. I was not able to finish todays assignment, which feels bad.  I started to rewrite it at around 6pm, so im just about ready for bed. Im hoping tomorrow Ill be able to finish whatever the project is a bit earlier than today, so Ill be able to go back to this code and fix my mistakes. Im very close to completing it. Damn it...
