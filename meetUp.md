#meetUP
I went to hack night at the AVVO on august 21st and on august 28th.
The first night I went, I was working on the Bus Mall project. I was stuck on getting the ID of the element being clicked on. While I was there, I met Dusty, who is an independent programmer who had just returned to working on his own code after working for several start ups. He was working on the library for a website he created. The website allow people to select a  popular outdoor activity, then they would be able to see spots in their area that were perfect for the activity they chose. The information was inputted by the users, as it required the user put in one activity & spot in their area for the website to use. He helped me get the ID of the element in my Bus Mall project. I had a really good conversation with him about how to get better at coding, as well as how to have a good mindset when approaching new languages.
The second night I went, I was working on our project (ghosTown), with Shayne and David. While I was there, I met Zac, who also an independent programmer, however he was also a coding coach at a bootcamp call flatiron school. I was attempting to at a delay to the options, so it would force the user to read the encounter before being able to click through. He showed me the setTimeout() function, which allowed me to do this.
