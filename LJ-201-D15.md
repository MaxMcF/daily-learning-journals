#LJ-D15
Today went well, It was fairly short, mostly a catchup day. Our team worked out a clearer picture of our project, which I'm very excited for. Were using the skeleton of my initial idea, but were using ghosts as the theme, which will be super cool stylistically. Im confident that our project will be both good and complete by the end of project week.
