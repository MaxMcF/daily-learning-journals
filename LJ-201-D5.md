#LJ-201-D5
Today felt awesome! Trying to figure out the questions that required a definite answer were much more challenging than previous days, but completing it felt very satisfying. The day started as normal, with Nick going over the previous nights reading, which can be very boring. I think a lot of that has to do with me not being a morning person, but at the same time, its a bit unnecessary for us to review a reading that we were already supposed to have completed before class. The lab was awesome. Once I finished I was able to help some other students, which always feels nice. I finished everything thats due for Monday, which I feel really good about.
