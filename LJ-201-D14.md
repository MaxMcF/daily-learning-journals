Today was fairly stressful. The additions to the bus mall were numerous, and because we had three people working all on the same project, there were a lot of moving parts, meaning a lot of room for error. We eventually were able to get everything functional, but damn did it take a lot of time and effort. I hop tomorrow is a bit more relaxed.
