#LJ-code201-day1
Today we reviewed some css and javascript basics. In the morning hours, we reviewed chapters 2, 10, and 17 of the HTML/CSS text and chapter 2 of the JS text.
After we got through the lecture, we were set free to work on our projects for the day. This is definitely my favorite part of the class, as we are given a lot freedom to explore HTML, CSS, and JS on our own, which is the best learning style for me. The project took a long time! CSS is a huge pain when you don't know all of the possible commands and options for those commands. I spent nearly an hour on trying to center two boxes of text in a larger div. Very frustrating. I did feel accomplished after the day was over though.
